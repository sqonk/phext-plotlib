# PHEXT PlotLib

[![Minimum PHP Version](https://img.shields.io/badge/PHP-%3E%3D%208-yellow)](https://php.net/)
[![License](https://sqonk.com/opensource/license.svg)](license.txt) [![Build Status](https://app.travis-ci.com/sqonk/phext-plotlib.svg?branch=master)](https://app.travis-ci.com/sqonk/phext-plotlib)

PlotLib is a wrapper for the PHP charting library JPGraph. It is designed for quickly outputting basic charts in bulk. Many options can be configured as needed but all have defaults. 

The main interface to the  library is through the BulkPlot class. While JPGraph supports a multitude of different chart types only a subset are currently supported by BulkPlot. Consider BulkPlot a convenience class that uses assumption to reduce the time required to otherwise build and render a graph.

You should ideally have a general understanding of how [JPGraph](https://jpgraph.net) works in order to get the most out of this library.

You can also combine it with [Visualise](https://github.com/sqonk/phext-visualise) to hook up real-time visual output when working from the command line. 

## Install

Via Composer

``` bash
$ composer require sqonk/phext-plotlib
```

## Documentation

[API Reference](docs/api/index.md) now available here.



## Example

``` php
use sqonk\phext\plotlib\BulkPlot;

$plot = new BulkPlot;

// add a chart with two line plots.
$plot->add('line', [
    	array_map(fn($v) => rand(1, 20), range(1, 10)),
    	array_map(fn($v) => rand(1, 20), range(1, 10))
    ], [
    'title' => 'lines',
    'xseries' => range(1, 10),
    'xformatter' => fn($v) => "Pt $v",
]);

// add a stacked bar chart.
$plot->add('barstacked', [
    	array_map(fn($v) => rand(1, 20), range(1, 10)),
    	array_map(fn($v) => rand(1, 20), range(1, 10))
    ], [
    'title' => 'bars',
    'auxlines' => [
    	['values' => array_map(fn($v) => rand(1, 20), range(1, 10)), 'legend' => 'auxlines']
    ]
]);

$l1 = [19,3,2,7,9,18,4,15,12,13];
$l2 = [17,20,19,17,19,5,13,8,15,8];

// A graph with horizontal and vertical rules.
$plot->add('line', [$l1, $l2], [
    'title' => 'Infinite Lines',
    'xseries' => range(1, 10),
    'font' => [FF_FONT1, FS_NORMAL, 8],
    'lines' => [
        ['direction' => 'h', 'value' => 7, 'color' => 'red'],
        ['direction' => 'v', 'value' => 4, 'color' => 'blue']
    ]
]);

// Finally, a plot with highlighted regions.
$plot->add('line', [$l1], [
    'title' => 'Regions',
    'xseries' => range(1, 10),
    'font' => [FF_FONT1, FS_NORMAL, 8],
    'regions' => [
        ['x' => 3, 'y' => 20, 'x2' => 7, 'y2' => 15, 'color' => 'red@0.3'],
        ['x' => 6, 'y' => 2, 'x2' => 10, 'y2' => 0, 'color' => 'red@0.3']
    ]
]);

// output all charts to a subfolder called 'plotlibtests'.
// this will output two files called 'lines.png' and 'bars.png'.
$plot->output_path('plotlibtests')->render();
```
